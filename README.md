# Manim Guide for Agents

Manim is a DSL created by 3blue1brown which lets you define videos in code... or let your coding agents do it!

[manim-voiceover-plus](https://github.com/MathBlocks/manim-voiceover-plus) is a manim plugin which lets you add AI-generated audio via ElevenLabs directly to the videos.

This `AGENTS.md` file tells the agent how to get all of this set up.

**Give your favorite coding agent this file, an ElevenLabs API key, and your video idea. Get out something like this!**
